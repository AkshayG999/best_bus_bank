## To streamline the process of merging changes from your feature-2 branch (development) to your main branch (production), you can follow these steps each time you want to push updates

## Script for Automation

```
chmod +x update_main.sh
```

Then you can run the script with:

```
./update_main.sh
```

This script will perform all the necessary steps to update your main branch with changes from feature-2 and push them to the remote repository.
